# By default, dnsmasq binds to the wildcard address.
#
# Bind to port 5353 to not collide with unbound. Only unbound needs to know about
# the resolver on this port. I can't listen on 127.0.0.1 because I need to ensure
# that port 67 is bound 192.168.2.10 so DHCP works.
port=5353

# Normally, dnsmasq would have an IP to forward requests to, but since I'm only
# expecting queries to come from unbound, I can leave this blank. dnsmasq will
# report a warning though.
# server=

# Tells dnsmasq to never forward A or AAAA queries for plain names, without dots
# or domain parts, to upstream nameservers. If the name is not known from
# /etc/hosts or DHCP then a "not found" answer is returned.
domain-needed

# Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command line or
# the dnsmasq configuration file.
#
# This is important for pippin because resolv.conf specifies the dnsmasq listen-address
# so that proemetheus can resolve middle-earth.internal. host names.
no-resolv

# Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie
# 192.168.x.x, etc) which are not found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file are
# answered with "no such domain" rather than being forwarded upstream.

# Logging is currently going to syslog and has potential to use my 50MB quota

# The DNS domain for DHCP, this config is equivalent to:
#
# domain=middle-earth.internal,192.168.2.0/24,local
# local=/middle-earth.internal/
# local=/0.2.168.192.in-addr.arpa/
#
# And this is what scopes middle-earth.internal and LAN PTR requests to dnsmasq only.
domain=middle-earth.internal,192.168.2.0/24,local

# this range intentionally doesn't overlap with the IP range the router
# provides which is 192.168.2.100-192.168.2.149 which is enabled when pippin
# is getting repaved and unavailable to respond to DHPC requests

# These hosts need to be defined here because I cannot configure the name they
# announce in their dhcp clients. They have a 1d expiry time so that some form of
# dhcp-client "heartbeat" is performed at least daily.
