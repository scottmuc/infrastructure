# Raspberry Pi Research

This is a place for all the notes I've taken over the repeated re-planting
of my Raspberry Pi.

## FreeBSD Paving Journal

Going with [FreeBSD][freebsd] for nostalgic reasons. There's a pretty easy
[howto][howto] that got me up and running quickly.

[freebsd]: https://www.freebsd.org/
[howto]: https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/freebsd/how-to-guides/installing-freebsd-for-raspberry-pi/

```
freebsd@generic:~ % uname -a
FreeBSD generic 12.1-RELEASE FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE r354233 GENERIC  arm64
```

* login as root and run `pkg`. It'll install the package manager
* `pkg install doas` and change root password to something very hard to guess

Create `/usr/local/etc/doas.conf` with the contents:

```
permit nopass keepenv :wheel
permit nopass keepenv root as root
```

* Set TZ: `doas cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin /etc/localtime`
* Set Date and Time: `doas date YYYYmmddHHMM.SS`

* Fetch the ports `doas portsnap fetch`
* Extract the ports `doas portsnap extract`

Install and configure exfat

```
/usr/ports/sysutils/fusefs-exfat
doas make install
```

**note** the above install was very slow. Next time I should look at installing some
of the dependencies as packages if possible.

* `perl5.30`, `gmake`, `iconv`, `gettext`, `autoconf`


* add `kld_list="fuse"` to `/etc/rc.conf` ([useful info][kld_list_help])
* `doas mkdir /mnt/extusb`
* add `/dev/da0s1 /mnt/extusb exfat rw,late,mountprog=/usr/local/sbin/mount.exfat  0 0` to `/etc/fstab` ([useful
  info][fstab_help]) **note** had to remove `noauto` since I do want the drive mounted once booted
* reboot to confirm that the mounting survives :-)

### Airsonic Journal

* Followed [installer documentation][freebsd-airsonic]

* `doas pkg install tomcat85`

OpenJDK has a message saying the following needs to be in `/etc/fstab`

```
fdesc /dev/fd fdescfs rw 0 0
proc /proc procfs rw 0 0
```

* add `tomcat85_enable="YES"` to `/etc/rc.conf` (this corresponds to a file called `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/tomcat85`)

**note** deploying the `airsonic.war` took a very long time. Over 40m so far. Response time is slow in
general too. I wonder this is a known [issue][gh-issue]?

[gh-issue]: https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/issues/881
[freebsd-airsonic]: https://airsonic.github.io/docs/install/example/freebsd-freenas/

OK, turns out [the docs][pi-docs] do state that openJDK will result in very slow deployments. I wasn't looking
at this page because I was looking at the FreeBSD page above. There's an [open issue][openjdk-issue] about
it as well.

In order to use the Oracle JDK, I need to run it in linux emulation. I couldn't run `kldload linux64` so
I'm assuming I don't have that module available to me.

### Navidrome Journal

Going to back out of the JDK/Airsonic path now and will aim to build navidrome on my laptop
and deploy the the pi thanks to Go's cross compiler.

I spoke too soon. There are native dependencies so I need to enable CGO which requires
a cross platform C compiler. 

https://dh1tw.de/2019/12/cross-compiling-golang-cgo-projects/

I also tried the route of creating a FreeBSD VM on my machine using Vagrant. I got build errors like:

```
vagrant@freebsd:~/workspace/navidrome % env CC=/usr/local/bin/aarch64-unknown-freebsd12.1-gcc CGO_ENABLED="1" GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=arm64 go build
# runtime/cgo
In file included from /usr/include/signal.h:43:0,
                 from gcc_freebsd_arm64.c:9:
/usr/include/sys/_ucontext.h:46:2: error: unknown type name 'mcontext_t'
  mcontext_t uc_mcontext;
  ^~~~~~~~~~
```

[These docs][ucontext] made me think that there's something in this dependency tree that is not quite portable. A rabbit
hole for another time. It's made it clear to me that understand cross platform compilation is an area that I don't
understand very well and could use a bit of studying here.

### FreeBSD Musings

I haven't really used FreeBSD since the 4.x/5.x era.

Some thing have changed:

* portsnap - no more cvsup! Port and pkg installation feel familiar
* doas seems to be mentioned more as a better alternative to sudo

I find FreeBSD follows a [Make me think!][make-me-think] philosophy. It doesn't do everything
automatically for you. When you install a service it won't auto-start it. You'll have to
explicitly enable it in /etc/rc.conf. Configuration is usually secure by default or, no configuration
exists and you'll be required to think about how you want to configure that thing you
just installed. I like this approach a lot. As I operate it, I feel like I'm improving my
understanding.

I'm amazed at the response that a couple tweets got. It left me with the impression that the 
FreeBSD is a community looking for opportunities to show support. I know it's anecdotal but
it did give me a very positive impression.

## Raspberry Pi OS

### Back to Raspian

Going to park FreeBSD at the moment.

Downloaded Raspberry OS Lite from [the website][raspi-download]. Ran `raspi-config` to enable
ssh access.

I thought I would go down setting up ingress first. The instructions for lets encrypt were
pretty easy: https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/debianbuster-nginx

```
apt-get install nginx certbot python-certbot-nginx
certbot --nginx
```

At some point I'll look at how all this works so I don't have to go through the interactive
installer next time I repave.

Good news is that https://home.scottmuc.com/ works now.

Getting the USB device mounted was just as easy in FreeBSD

```
apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils
mkdir /media/extusb
mount -t exfat /dev/sda1 /media/extusb

# /etc/fstab entry
UUID=5A47-F8E2 /mnt/usb exfat defaults,auto,users,rw,nofail,umask=000 0 0
```

At the moment, I'm happy to re-mount things after a reboot.

I followed the [pre-built binaries][prebuild] installation instructions and it was painless.
However, I am having issues reading my music library. I get the following error message:

```
ERRO[0002] Error importing MediaFolder                   error="error extracting metadata files" folder=/home/pi/music
ERRO[0002] Errors while scanning media. Please check the logs
ERRO[0002] Error scanning media folder                   error="errors while scanning media" folder=/home/pi/music
```

This happens even when I copy a single mp3 and put it into a folder and configure navidrome to look
at the one. Going to try installing ffmpeg through apt now.

After installing `ffmpeg` through apt, the reading of the library works now. To enable public access
I added the following to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

```
        location /music/ {
                proxy_pass http://pi.home.scottmuc.com:4533;
        }
```

Need to figure out how to now do ngninx surgery to get everything configured. Especially since the
`certbot` it automatically doing things to this file. I'll likely change that later.

### Samba Setup

I recall doing this many years ago. This is what I did:

`apt-get install samba`

Inside `/etc/samba/smb.conf` I added the lines

```
[All Stuff]
  path = /mnt/usbdisk
  browseable = yes
  read only = no
  guest ok = yes
```

### DNS

I would like to reduce the ads and protect my network so I thought I would
tinker with [pi-hole][pi-hole-install].

The curl-bash did the trick. I'm not too happy with the install though. Why
can't it be installed as a debian package? I also didn't like that it blindly
installed lighttpd which also binds to port 80 when I already have nginx
running.

[pi-hole-install]: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#one-step-automated-install

#### Why Not PiHole

1. The `curl bash` script is way too large and complicated to understand for me.
2. It installs another `httpd` server when I already have one installed. Though it
   appears I could [disable this][disable-http].
3. It still requires you to install a resursive resolver if you don't want to
   delegte resolution to one of the upstream providers (I didn't know this going
   into things). I wanted to avoid third-party upstream providers in the first
   place.
4. Not a fan that it's a fork of [`dnsmasq`][dnsmasq].
5. Why can I not install it via `apt-get intsall`? And if I can, why the `curl bash`?
6. I sense that pi-hole is intended to be more of an appliance type application
   and therefore it's best to dedicate a machine to it. It doesn't appear to
   play well in a shared server.

Some of my complaints might be me not understanding things but the more I
looked into it, the more layers and confusion I found.

### DHCP

I think eventually it would be best to use the Pi as my DHCP server (for
the auto DNS server setting).

I cannot switch DNS in my router config but I can at least disable DHCP.

Started looking at `kea` for DHCP because it looks like the old server is
being phased out. Wasn't a fan of seeing `mysql` dependencies being installed:

```
pi@pi:~ $ sudo apt-get install kea-dhcp4-server
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
  kea-common liblog4cplus-1.1-9 libmariadb3 libpq5 mariadb-common mysql-common
Suggested packages:
  kea-doc
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  kea-common kea-dhcp4-server liblog4cplus-1.1-9 libmariadb3 libpq5 mariadb-common mysql-common
```

Here's the config I got working in `/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf`:

```json
{
  "Dhcp4": {
    "valid-lifetime": 4000,
    "renew-timer": 1000,
    "rebind-timer": 2000,
    "interfaces-config": {
      "interfaces": [
        "eth0"
      ]
    },
    "lease-database": {
      "type": "memfile",
      "persist": true,
      "name": "/var/lib/kea/dhcp4.leases"
    },
    "subnet4": [
      {
        "subnet": "192.168.2.0/24",
        "pools": [
          {
            "pool": "192.168.2.100 - 192.168.2.200"
          }
        ],
        "option-data": [
          {
            "name": "routers",
            "data": "192.168.2.1"
          },
          {
            "name": "domain-name-servers",
            "data": "192.168.2.10"
          },
          {
            "code": 15,
            "data": "home.scottmuc.com"
          },
          {
            "name": "domain-search",
            "data": "home.scottmuc.com"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

It took many troubleshooting of json parsing errors to figure things out. There
exists [comprehensive docs][kea-docs] but it still took some trial and error.

[kea-docs]: https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/kea-1.6.2/arm/dhcp4-srv.html#dhcpv4-server-configuration

Next rebuild I'm going to look at using [`isc-dhcp-server`][isc-info] as it looks
nicer to configure despite its age.

### Prometheus

Existing buster apt repo has prometheus 2.7.1 available whereas 2.19.x is the latest

https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/debian/

Turns out the URL above doesn't have prometheus in it. Decided to with a tarball install
similar to navidrome. Was able to configure it so it stored its DB on the USB drive

[Install script](prometheus.sh)
