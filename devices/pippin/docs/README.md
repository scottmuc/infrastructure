# Raspberry Pi Configuration Management Documentation and Diary

## Now

The introduction of the [Ansible phase](ANSIBLE.md) made repaving
a breeze as well as extending the pi to do more things.

## The Manual Configuration Period

The [Manual configuration](MANUAL.md) document helped me repave
the pi a couple times with decent results. Of course there were
steps I would miss or forget, but they kindled the automation that
was to follow.

## The Research Period

[These docs](RESEARCH.md) journal my first couple months with
the raspberry pi. At first I was going to use FreeBSD, but had
some issues. This became a useful document to feed into the
next phase.
