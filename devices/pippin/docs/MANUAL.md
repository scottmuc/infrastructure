# Manual Raspberry Pi Setup

I now have a raspberry pi and this is how I set it up. The setup has been
informed by the [research](RESEARCH.md) I've done.

# Current Hardware

This is what I [bought from amazon][amazon].

[amazon]: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07BNPZVR7

# Current Operating System

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ uname -a
Linux raspberrypi 4.19.118-v7+ #1311 SMP Mon Apr 27 14:21:24 BST 2020 armv7l GNU/Linux
```

# Features

* Ad blocking DNS for all networked devices
* Personal music streaming service
* Apartment network storage

# Setup

Why no standard configuration management tools? Mainly because I don't think
they are needed for an environment where I am the only maintainer. If I were to
distribute this as a "solution", I woud look to distribute in a more understood
way. For this device I am quite content with a supervised partially automated
setup.

## 1. Fresh machine configuration

Run `raspi-config` and enable SSHD and set the timezone.

## 2. Network configuration

Turn off `dhcpcd` and statically set the IP ([instructions][static-ip]). I saw
that a lot of people set static IPs in their `dhcpcd` configuration. I don't
really understand why one would continuing running `dhcpcd` when you are going
to statically assign the IP.

[static-ip]: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/78510/disable-dhcpcd-service-for-static-ip

```
systemctl stop dhcpcd
systemctl disable dhcpd
apt remove dhcpd5
```


```
# /etc/cnetwork/interfaces.d/eth0

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.2.10
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.2.1
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
dns-search home.scottmuc.com
```

## 3. Setup Nginx ingress and TLS

```
apt-get install nginx certbot
certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html -d home.scottmuc.com -m "scottmuc@gmail.com"
```

In `/etc/nginx/sites-available/home.scottmuc.com` paste in the following:

```
server {
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name home.scottmuc.com;

    location /music/ {
        proxy_pass http://pi.home.scottmuc.com:4533;
    }

    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on;
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/home.scottmuc.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/home.scottmuc.com/privkey.pem;
}

server {
    if ($host = home.scottmuc.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    listen 80 ;
    listen [::]:80 ;
    server_name home.scottmuc.com;
    return 404;
}
```

Need to research if using the `--nginx` flag to `certbot` is worth it. It adds
a separate `dh_key` along with some `ngninx` specific configuration.

Added the following for work related quality-of-life improvement.

```
server {
    listen 80 ;
    listen [::]:80 ;
    server_name work.scottmuc.com;
    return 301 https://myvmware.workspaceair.com/;
}
```

## 4. Setup external USB

```
apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils
mkdir /mnt/usb

# /etc/fstab entry
UUID=5A47-F8E2 /mnt/usb exfat defaults,auto,users,rw,nofail,umask=000 0 0
```

Then reboot to confirm the mount "sticks".

## 5. Install and run navidrome

Run [`navidrome.sh`](navidrome.sh) as `root` on the Pi.

## 6. Install and configure Samba

`apt-get install samba`

Add the following to `/etc/samba/smb.conf`
```
[All Stuff]
  path = /mnt/usb
  browseable = yes
  read only = no
  guest ok = no
  valid users = pi
```

Then create the user:

`sudo smbpasswd -a pi`

After restarting the service `sudo systemctl restart smbd.service` the share
will be accessible with that account.

## 7. Install and setup ad blocking DNS resolver

I was initially looking at [pi-hole][pi-hole] but upon
[further investigation][pihole-research], I found it didn't fit how I like to
 operate things.

[pi-hole]: https://pi-hole.net/
[pihole-research]: RESEARCH.md#dns

Instead I decided to go with [`unbound`][unbound-homepage]. The decision is mainly
because the BSDs chose to use it and I trust them. Little did I know that I was
in for an operators treat. The [documentation][unbound-docs] were great and was
able to get everything working to my liking by following them.

[unbound-homepage]: https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/
[unbound-docs]: https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/

```
apt-get install unbound
```

I then needed to tweak the configuration so I had logs, and appropriate level
of access.

Create `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole-replacement.conf` with the contents:

```
server:
  interface: 0.0.0.0
  access-control: 192.168.2.0/24 allow
```

```
# Create the blacklist configuration
sudo curl -Lo /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/blacklist.conf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oznu/dns-zone-blacklist/master/unbound/unbound-nxdomain.blacklist

sudo service unbound restart
```

Need to change so I don't mess up my `/etc/resolv.conf` on reboot:

```
# /etc/cnetwork/interfaces.d/eth0

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.2.10
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.2.1
dns-nameservers 127.0.0.1 <------
dns-search home.scottmuc.com
```

There were some decisions made on choosing to return `NXDOMAIN` or `0.0.0.0` for the blacklisted
hosts. I'm still not sure what's betterr for my scenario but here's some reading:

* https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/blockingmode/#pi-holes-nxdomain-blocking

## 8. Configure Pi to be a DHCP Server

This is still a work in progress but I have something working. I put my
notes in my [research doc](RESEARCH.md#dhcp)
